'''
Minimum Number Of Squares

A number can always be represented as a sum of squares of other numbers. Note that 1 is a square and we can always break a number as [(1 * 1) + (1 * 1) + (1 * 1) + â€¦]. Given a number n, find the minimum number of squares that sum to n.

Input format:
The first and only line of input contains an integer N (1 <= N <= 10000)

Constraints:
Time Limit: 1 seconds

Output format:
The first and only line of output contains the minimum number if squares that sum to n.

Sample Test Cases:
Sample Input 1:
100

Sample Output 1:
1

Explanation:
We can write 100 as 10^2 also, 100 can be written as (5^2) + (5^2) + (5^2) + (5^2), but this representation requires 4 squares. So, in this case, the expected answer would be 1, that is, 10^2.
